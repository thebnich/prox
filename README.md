# prox

## Installation
Install CocoaPods. If you already have CocoaPods installed, run the same
command to update:

    sudo gem install cocoapods

If it has been a while since you last updated CocoaPods, you may want to update
your pods spec repo (this can take some time):

    pod repo update

Run the checkout script:

    ./checkout.sh

Open the workspace. You will need to use the workspace to do development from
now on. Attempting to compile the .xcodeproj by itself will result in
compilation failures:

    open Prox.xcworkspace

### Services and API keys
For a successful build, you need the `Prox/Prox/GoogleService-Info.plist` and
`Prox/Prox/APIKeys.plist` files, which contain secure information to connect
to Firebase, our backend services, and APIs. *Please do not add this file to
version control.*

If you are a team member, this file is available in the Engineering gdrive. If
you are not, please contact a team member directly to discuss receiving this
file for development.
